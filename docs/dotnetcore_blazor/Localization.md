## GridBlazor for ASP.NET Core MVC

# Localization

[Index](Documentation.md)

English is the default laguage. But you can use other languages. You have to create a **CultureInfo** on the razor page and pass it as parameter in the contructor of the **GridClient** object:
    
```c#
    var locale = new CultureInfo("de-DE");
    var client = new GridClient<Order>(q => orderService.GetOrdersGridRows(columns, q), query, false, "ordersGrid", Columns, locale);
```

## Supported languages

* French

## Right to left direction
Those languages that require right to left direction are also supported. You must configure the grid to user RTL direction using the ```SetDirection``` method of the ```GridClient``` object:
    
```c#
    var client = new GridClient<Order>(q => orderService.GetOrdersGridRows(columns, q), query, false, "ordersGrid", Columns, locale)
        .SetDirection(GridDirection.RTL);
```
