## Blazor client-side with OData back-end

# Grouping

[Index](Documentation.md)

You can enable grouping for all columns of a grid using the **Groupable** method for the **GridODataClient** object:

```c#
    var client = new GridODataClient<Order>(httpClient, url, query, false, "ordersGrid", columns, 10, locale)
        .Groupable();
```

You can drag the column title and drop it on the sorting area. 
You can add multiple columns at the same time and select if sorting is ascending or descending column by column.
The grid items will be grouped by the values of the selected columns.

This is an example of a table of items using grouping:
