Users can navigate between pages using the mouse or using the keyboard.

These are the keys to be used:

- [Ctrl] + [Left] and [Ctrl] + [Right] arrows navigate between pages
- [Ctrl] + [Home] key goes to the first page
- [Ctrl] + [End] key goes to the last page
- [Ctrl] + [Up] and [Ctrl] + [Down] arrows navigate from one row to another for grids where rows are selectable. It doesn´t work when multiselectable is enabled. 
- [Tab] key navigates among elements of a filter widget when it is visible
- [Esc] key minimises a filter widget when it is visible
- [Ctrl] +[Backspace] clear all filters
