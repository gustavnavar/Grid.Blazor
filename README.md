# Grid.Blazor

GridBlazor is a Blazor component that shows data in a grid. It requires a back-end component that performs paging, sorting, filtering and others. 

This back-end component can be one of the following:
- GridCore (v.5.0.0 or later), supporting ASP.Net Core 3.1, ASP.Net 5.0, ASP.Net 6.0 and ASP.Net 7.0. GridMvcCore, that it is a fork from https://gridmvc.codeplex.com/, was working for earlier versions. But GridMvcCore is only required for Blazor WASM (REST) and ASP.NET MVC projects now.
- an OData back-end. All samples are based on Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData library, but it can be any other OData provider.

It supports .NET Core 3.1 and 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0, and Blazor WebAssembly 3.2.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0

## Demo

## Migration to GridBlazor 3.5.0 and GridCore 5.5.0 from GridBlazor 3.0.0 and GridCore 5.0.0 for Blazor WASM projects with REST back-end

1. You have to remove the package ```GridCore``` and install the package ```GridMvcCore```, and upgrade the ```GridBlazor``` package

2. You must replace all ```GridCore``` instances by ```GridServer``` ones

3. The ```Grid``` property of the ```GridServer``` object has an ```SGrid<T>``` type, instead of ```ISGrid<T>``` it was before. You should change any reference to this property to reflect this change.

4. Some classes have been moved from the ```GridCore``` package to the ```GridMvc``` one. Change all required ```using ...``` as needed.

## Notes

- GridBlazor 3.4.1 supports the build-in InputFile component for columns of type "file" for .Net 6.0 and later projects. The old Agno.BlazorInputFile component is ussed for .Net Core 3.1 and .Net 5.x projects. See https://github.com/gustavnavar/Grid.Blazor/blob/master/docs/blazor_client/Crud.md#file-type-columns

- GridBlazor 3.0.0 supports .Net 6.0

- GridMvcCore has been split in 2 parts from version 5.0.0 on:
    - GridCore: it includes all code necessary for the back-end Blazor applications (data processing, filtering, sorting, etc.), excluding all MVC dependencies (Razor view and pages rendering).
    - GridMvcCore: it only includes all MVC dependencies required for rendering Razor views and pages.

- Sorting is implemented on GridBlazor 2.1.2, GridMvcCore 4.1.2 and newer versions following this sequence "no sort" -> "sort ascending" -> "sort descending" -> "no sort" and so on when a column title is clicked 

- GridMvcCore 3.0.0 does not support .Net Core 2.x. It requires .NET Core 3.1

- GridBlazor 1.6.7 requires a change on the column definition when selecting rows with checkboxes using the ```SetCheckboxColumn``` method. It's mandatory to identify the columns that are primary keys for the grid. You must do it using the SetPrimaryKey(true) method for the primary key columns' definitions:

    ```c#
        c.Add("CheckboxColumn").SetCheckboxColumn(true, o => o.Customer.IsVip);
        c.Add(o => o.OrderID).SetPrimaryKey(true);
    ```

- GridBlazor 1.6.2 doesn't support the ```CheckedRows``` property anymore. ```CheckedRows``` only allowed to retrieve the checked values, but not to change them. Use the ```Checkboxes``` property instead of it.

- GridBlazor 1.5.0 supports OData server back-ends for Blazor WA applications. More info [here](./docs/blazor_odata/Documentation.md)

- Versions before GridBlazor 1.3.9 had the keyboard navigation enabled by default. This feature requires to focus on the grid element, but it can create problems when used on pages with 2 or more grids. As a consequence, starting with version 1.3.9 it has to be explicitly configured for each grid that requires keyboard navigation. Users can enable keyboard navigation between pages using the ```SetKeyboard``` method of the ```GridClient``` object:

    ```c#
        var client = new GridClient<Order>( ... ).SetKeyboard(true);
    ```

- Grid components have been moved to ```GridBlazor.Pages``` folder in GridBlazor 1.3.2. You must add a reference to this namespace in the ```_Imports.razor```: 

    ```razor
        @using GridBlazor.Pages
    ```

- Blazor Server App require these changes on to the **_Host.cshtml** file for .Net Core 3.1:
    
    ```html
        <link href="_content/GridBlazor/css/gridblazor.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
        <script src="_content/GridBlazor/js/gridblazor.js"></script>
    ```

- Blazor WebAssembly projects require these changes on to the **wwwroot/index.html** file for version 3.2.0 Preview 1:
    
    ```html
        <link href="_content/GridBlazor/css/gridblazor.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
        <script src="_content/GridBlazor/js/gridblazor.js"></script>
    ```

- Blazor WebAssembly projects require to use a new constructor of the **GridClient** object including an HttpClient object from Dependency Injection for .Net Core 3.1:
    
    ```razor
        @page "/..."
        @inject HttpClient httpClient

        ...
    
        protected override async Task OnParametersSetAsync()
        {
            ...
            var client = new GridClient<Order>(httpClient, url, query, false, "ordersGrid", Columns);
            ...
        }
    
    ```

- The button to clear all filters is disabled by default starting from ```GridBlazor``` version 1.3.6. You can enable it using the ***ClearFiltersButton*** method of the **GridClient** object:  

    ```razor
        var client = new GridClient<Order>(httpClient, url, query, false, "ordersGrid", Columns).ClearFiltersButton(true);
    ```

The SQL Server database for all demos can be downloaded from [here](./GridMvc.Demo/App_Data)

Alternatively, if you prefer to install a fresh version of the database you can perform the following steps:
- run this script from Microsoft web to create a new database: https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/blob/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs/instnwnd.sql
- add a column to the Customers table with the name IsVip of type bit (NOT NULL) and default value 0:
    ```sql
        USE Northwind;
        ALTER TABLE dbo.Customers ADD IsVip bit NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 WITH VALUES;
        GO
    ```
- change manually some values of the new IsVip column to True
- review the datetime columns. Any mismatch between EF Core model and database definitions will produce an exception and filtering will not work as expected. If database columns are defined as ```datetime``` you must modify the ```NorthwindDbContext``` class including:
    ```c#
        modelBuilder.Entity<Order>().Property(r => r.OrderDate).HasColumnType("datetime");
    ```
    for each datetime column. Or you can change all database columns' type to ```datetime2(7)```.
